# Changing Background Images Animation

This is a simple guide to help you implement a background image animation using HTML and CSS. By following these instructions, you'll be able to create an engaging and visually appealing background that smoothly transitions between multiple images.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. You'll need a text editor to write your code and a web browser to preview your animation.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Set up your project

1. Create a new folder for your project on your computer.
2. Open your preferred text editor and create a new HTML file.
3. Save the file as `index.html` in your project folder.

### Step 2: HTML Structure



### Step 3: CSS Styling

1. Create a new file in your project folder and name it `styles.css`.
2. Open `styles.css` in your text editor.
3. Add the following CSS code to style the background animation:

Make sure to replace `'image1.jpg'`, `'image2.jpg'`, `'image3.jpg'`, and `'image4.jpg'` with the actual file names and paths of your desired background images.

### Step 4: JavaScript (Optional)

If you want to add more interactivity or customize the animation further, you can use JavaScript. Create a new file in your project folder called `script.js` and add your JavaScript code there.

### Step 5: Preview

1. Save all your changes.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to see the background image animation in action.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the animation duration (`10s` in the example) and the image URLs inside the `@keyframes` rule to suit your preferences. You can also modify other CSS properties to adjust the positioning, sizing, or other visual aspects of the background.
